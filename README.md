# Jenesei Template for React Project

A production-ready React application template used as a starting point for Jenesei frontend projects.

The template includes routing, data fetching, localization, PWA support, environment-based builds, app metadata injection, icon generation, robots.txt handling, and a strict formatting/linting setup.

## Stack

- React 19
- Vite 8
- TypeScript 6
- TanStack Router
- TanStack Query
- TanStack Form
- i18next and react-i18next
- Jenesei Kit React
- Vite PWA
- Biome
- Yarn

## Requirements

- Node.js `22.18.0`
- Yarn

Use the Node version from `.nvmrc`:

```bash
nvm use
```

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Start the local development server:

```bash
yarn start
```

By default, Vite starts on port `3000`. The port can be changed with `VITE_PORT`.

  pages/                      Public and private route pages
```

Public assets are stored in `public/`.

Localization files are stored in:

```text
public/locales/en/translation.json
public/locales/ru/translation.json
```

Robots files are stored in `robots/`.

## Routing

Routing is configured with TanStack Router in `src/core/router/router.tsx`.

Current route groups:

- `/pu` for public routes
- `/pu/home` for the public home page
- `/pr` for private routes
- `/pr/home` for the private home page

The root route redirects unknown routes to the public route group. The public and private route groups redirect their base paths to their home pages.

## Providers

The app-level provider tree is defined in `src/app.tsx`.

It includes:

- screen width provider
- language provider
- error boundary layout
- TanStack Query provider
- permission provider
- geolocation provider
- dialog provider
- PWA provider
- router layout

## Localization

i18next is initialized in `src/core/i18n/index.ts`.

The app supports language-only detection and loads translations from:

```text
/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json
```

Supported languages are configured in `src/core/consts/index.ts`.

When adding a language:

1. Add the language metadata to `OBJECT_LANGUAGE`.
2. Add a new translation file under `public/locales/<lng>/translation.json`.
3. Keep translation keys aligned across all locale files.

## PWA

PWA support is configured in `vite.config.ts` through `vite-plugin-pwa`.

The service worker helper is implemented in `src/classes/class-sw/index.ts` and exposed to React through `ProviderPWA`.

Important behavior:

- Service worker registration is enabled only when `env.mode === 'prod'`.
- The app can detect offline readiness.
- The app can detect available updates.
- The app can reset service worker cache and reload from a clean state.
- New app versions are read from `/build-info.txt` when an update is available.

## Icons and Manifest

Application icons are generated by `@jenesei-software/jenesei-plugin-vite`.

Source logo:

```text
public/logos/logo-jenesei-id.png
```

Generated icons are written to:

```text
public/icons/
```

The generated icons are used in both `index.html` and the PWA manifest.

## Robots

`viteStaticCopy` copies the mode-specific robots file to `robots.txt` during build.

Configured modes:

| Mode | Source file | Meta robots |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dev` | `robots/robots.dev.txt` | `noindex, nofollow` |
| `stage` | `robots/robots.stage.txt` | `noindex, nofollow` |
| `prod` | `robots/robots.prod.txt` | `index, follow` |

Make sure every build mode has a matching robots file before using it in CI/CD.

## Code Style

Formatting and linting are handled by Biome.

Key conventions:

- TypeScript strict mode is enabled.
- Imports are organized by Biome.
- Use the `@local/*` alias for imports from `src`.
- Keep code comments and in-code instructions in English.
- Keep shared logic in `src/core`.
- Keep route-level UI in `src/pages`.
- Keep layout concerns in `src/layouts`.

Before opening a pull request, run:

```bash
yarn biome:format
yarn biome:lint:check
yarn build:dev
```

## Build

Create a production build:

```bash
yarn build:prod
```

The output directory is controlled by `VITE_OUTPUT_DIR` and defaults to `build`.

## Deployment Notes

- Provide all required `VITE_*` variables for the selected mode.
- Ensure `robots.txt` behavior matches the target environment.
- Ensure `VITE_APP_VERSION` is updated by the release process.
- Publish or generate `/build-info.txt` if the PWA update prompt should display the new version.
- Serve the built app as a single page application with fallback to `index.html`.

## Troubleshooting

If the app starts on an unexpected port, check `VITE_PORT`.

If a build fails while copying `robots.txt`, verify that the selected Vite mode has a matching file in `robots/`.

If PWA updates do not appear locally, remember that service worker registration is enabled only for `prod` mode.

If translations do not load, check the language code in `OBJECT_LANGUAGE` and make sure the matching file exists in `public/locales/<lng>/translation.json`.
